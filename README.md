The code for the heartrate monitor Electronics Design Project, written to compiled with the mbed toolchain for a suitable microcontroller. 

Takes the amplified signal of a light based hearbeat sensor in and can display either the waveform, or the bpm of the signal on an 8x8 led matrix display.

The project had to be cut short due to covid-19, when access to the hardware for testing was lost.
